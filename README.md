# My SQL Project!
This is my initial foray into Using SQL for Data Analysis. Using the rubric provided by Udacity for this section of my Business Analytics Nanodegree coursework, I've produced a visualization of my ability to execute core SQL commands to define, select, manipulate, control access, aggregate, and join data and data tables.
The Queries.txt file shows my queries used that produced my visualization.
